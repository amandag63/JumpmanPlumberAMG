**Will Schottler –** Will’s main role is to be the team leader. He is in charge of divvying up the work so that each team member has an equal part in the implementation of our program. He is also a software developer and will most likely be the main person committing to master due to his familiarity with Git and GitHub. 
**Amanda Goodridge –** Amanda’s role is to keep track of the documentation within the group. Documentation includes the project tab specifications on GitHub (TODO, DOING, DONE tabs), letting the instructor know of any problems that the group may be having, and making sure communication is shared among the group. She is also a software developer.
**Kaitlin Veith –** Kaitlin’s role is to work with the design portion of our project. She will be a software developer, as well, but her focus will be in what the images and obstacles in our program do at certain points in the program.
